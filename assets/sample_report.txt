**Radiology Report**

**1. TECHNIQUE:**

*   AP Chest Radiograph

**2. FINDINGS:**

*   Bilateral pleural effusions are present, appearing as hazy densities in the lower lung fields.
*   Evidence of pulmonary edema is present, manifested as increased interstitial markings.
*   The heart size appears within normal limits.
*   There are no acute bony abnormalities.

**3. IMPRESSION:**

*   Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema are present. The etiology is unclear without further clinical information, but could be related to heart failure, 
kidney disease, or other conditions causing fluid overload. The presence of pulmonary edema suggests a potential cardiac or pulmonary etiology. Further evaluation, 
including echocardiography and blood tests, is recommended to determine the underlying cause.

**4. RECOMMENDATIONS:**

*   Echocardiography to evaluate cardiac function and rule out heart failure.
*   Blood tests (e.g., BNP, electrolytes, renal function) to assess for underlying causes of fluid overload.
*   Consider other causes of pulmonary edema based on clinical presentation.
*   If the etiology remains unclear, further investigation may be warranted.
